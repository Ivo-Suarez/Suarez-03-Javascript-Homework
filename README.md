  ## An initial attempt at creating a random password generator

# Description

  ## I was able to add the desired html elements required by the assignment, represented in checkboxes for four of the password parameters, and a number input for the password length. A small amount of css work was done to clean up the presentation of those inputs. On the JavaScript side, I think I managed to create the code for the generation of the password itself, but I struggled to complete the 'addEventListener' portion. I think with some additional work, it should be operational.
